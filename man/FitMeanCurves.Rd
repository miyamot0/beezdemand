FitMeanCurves(
  dat,
  equation,
  k,
  remq0e = FALSE,
  replfree = NULL,
  rem0 = FALSE,
  nrepl = NULL,
  replnum = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame (long form) of purchase task data.}

\item{equation}{Character vector of length one. Accepts either "hs" for Hursh and Silberberg (2008) or "koff" for Koffarnus, Franck, Stein, and Bickel (2015).}

\item{k}{A numeric vector of length one. Reflects the range of consumption in log10 units. If none provided, k will be calculated based on the max/min of the entire sample. If k = "fit", k will be a free parameter}

\item{remq0e}{If TRUE, removes consumption and price where price == 0. Default value is FALSE}

\item{replfree}{Optionally replaces price == 0 with specified value. Note, if fitting using equation == "hs", and 0 is first price, 0 gets replaced by replfree. Default value is .01}

\item{rem0}{If TRUE, removes all 0s in consumption data prior to analysis. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{nrepl}{Number of zeros to replace with replacement value (replnum). Can accept either a number or "all" if all zeros should be replaced. Default is to replace the first zero only.}

\item{replnum}{Value to replace zeros. Default is .01}

\item{method}{Character string of length 1. Accepts "Mean" to fit to mean data or "Pooled" to fit to pooled data}
